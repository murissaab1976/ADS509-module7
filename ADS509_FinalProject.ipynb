    "Short Description:\n",
    "This project aims to explore the automated classification and topic discovery of news articles gathered from various categories using the NewsAPI. The primary goal is to build a classification model to categorize articles into predefined groups such as \"Technology,\" \"Sports,\" \"Health,\" and \"Business,\" followed by topic modeling to uncover latent themes. The project will compare how well the discovered topics match with the pre-existing categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "To collect raw news article data via the NewsAPI.\n",
    "To clean, tokenize, and normalize the data for analysis.\n",
    "To build a classification model to categorize the articles based on predefined categories.\n",
    "To build a topic model to discover underlying themes in the data.\n",
    "To evaluate the accuracy of the classification model and compare the topics discovered through topic modeling with the pre-existing categories.\n",
    "To provide insights into how well the discovered topics align with the original article categories.\n"
